------INFO------
    Each file has to be in a separate folder with a file named "dest" containing
its absolute path in the system. The last part of its path has to be the actual
file's name.
    Run distribute_dots.sh to create symlinks of the dotfiles across the system.
The user will be prompted  for each symlink  whether to remove the destination
file.
    Run add_dot.sh <file> <name> to add a file to the set of dotfiles. A new
folder in dotfiles/ will be created with the name <name>. The file <file> will
be moved in that folder, a symlink to it will be placed in its old directory.

*  add_dot.sh may not work well with path variables such as $ZSH consider
*  editing the path yourself. (dotfiles/<name>/dest)
